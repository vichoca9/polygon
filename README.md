# polygon
Program for finding how many regular subpolygons 
are inside a regular one

## Problem
Given a regular polygon with N sides, draw all the 
diagonals and find the intersections.For the union of
this set of vertices, find all the posible regular 
subpolygons that can be made by all the posible 
combinations of vertices.
